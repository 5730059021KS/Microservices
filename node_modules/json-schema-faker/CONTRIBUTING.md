Contribution to the project is more than welcome! Please stick to the following rules:

* When submitting *bugs* (or inappropriate behavior), do *paste your schema example* if only it's possible. This will prevent us from explicitly asking you to do this.
* When submitting *PRs*, ship them under the `develop` branch.
* Releasing new version should:
  * include a new entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file,
  * be followed by rebuilding and re-releasing new online demo, see [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/pateketrueke/json-schema-faker/tree/gh-pages).
