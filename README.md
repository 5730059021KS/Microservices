# The Microservice Store Application

A Demo "Timeshare store" used in this Microservices Architecture tutorial: http://blog.ibmjstart.net/2015/07/23/learning-microservices-architecture-bluemix-docker-part-1/

This branch contains the completed project. You will still need to modify the Dockerfiles with the correct MONGO_URI, and don't forget to update public/Index.html with the API urls.
